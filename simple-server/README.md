# About Simple Server

What is necessary to up and running a server? And first of all, what's a server?

So, I could say that a server is a program that receive a request (input of some data) and process a response to delivery to whatever thing or person that make the request.

And of course, in the Web development context, a server will work with HTTP protocol, and it has some rules and patterns to follow.

Essencialy, a server will be exposed by one of system operation port that will receive a request informing a server ip with a port and the program will do something that it is build to do, like, serve a html file for example.
